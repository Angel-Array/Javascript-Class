    <!--Functions are one of the fundermaental building blocks of javascript
    A function is a Javascript Method
    It is a set of statement that performs a task or produces a value
    It is executed when it is invoked(called) by something.
    
    <p id="demo"></p>
    -->

    <!--
        CAllING A FUNCTION
        functions wil only be executed when they are called or invoked,
        A function can be called inside a Javascript program, just like what we did in the previous example 

        A function can be called when an event happens, most commontly when a button is clicked.
    

    <p id="demo">sum will be printed here</p>
    <button onclick="addNumbers(2, 5)">Add</button>

        Global variables
        Global variables  can be used by function
        Global viarables are varaibles declared outside a function
        
        Now let look at the example below, declaring a fruit varaible outside it function.
    

    <p id="demo"></p>
    <button onclick="myFunc()">Call Function</button>

                WHY USE FUNCTION
        function in Javascript are just like tools in real life. they make coding faster.
        Instead of writing a block of codes over and over again, we can just reuse the same code my times.

        The function example below, is to converts kilometer to miles.
    -->

    <p id="demo">sum will be printed here</p>
    <button onclick="multiplyNumbers(2, 5)">Multiply</button>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script src="app.js"></script>
